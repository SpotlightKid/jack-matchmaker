2019-04-15 version 0.7.0
------------------------

New features:

* Added support for listing and matching port `meta data`_ pretty-names
  (supported only with JACK1 or JACK2 >= 1.9.13 or development version).
* Added command line option ``-e``, ``--exact-matching`` for exact port name
  matching mode.
* Added command line option ``-N``, ``--client-name`` to set JACK client name.

Enhancements:

* Expanded documentation in README_ to explain pattern matching and
  match group substitution and with more and better examples.
* Added badge images & links to README_.
* Improved handling of port name decoding.
* Added a couple of example scripts for ``jacklib`` usage to repo.
* Updated Python versions in ``setup.py`` classifiers.

Fixes:

* Re-compile input port pattern for each output port as it may have changed
  due to match group substitution.
* Fixed probable memory leak from not freeing ``jack_get_ports`` results.
* Fixed wrong return type of JACK port rename callback function declaration.

2017-10-17 version 0.6.0
------------------------

* Automatically tries to re-connect to JACK if the server not available on

  connection.


2016-11-05 version 0.5.0
------------------------

  on their own or together and in combination with the ``-a``,
  ``--list-aliases`` option.
* Removed prefixes and separators from port and connection listings (so the
  output can be more easily parsed in shell scripts or the output of
  ``jack-matchmaker -c`` can be piped into a file and directly used with the
  ``-p``, ``--pattern-file`` option).
* Added ``--version`` command line option.
* Excluded currently unused ``alsainfo`` module from distribution.
